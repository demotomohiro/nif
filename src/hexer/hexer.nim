Hexer
------

Hexer performs backend tasks that need to operate on multiple NIF files at once:

- It copies used imported symbols into the current NIF file. As a fix point operation
  until no foreign symbols are left.
- `importc`'ed symbols are replaced by their `.c` variants.
- `importc`'ed symbols might lead to `(incl "file.h")` injections.
- Nim types must be translated to NIFC types.
- Types and procs must be moved to toplevel statements.


Grammar
-------

Hexer accepts Gear 2's grammar.
